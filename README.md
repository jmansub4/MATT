# SMTT

Segment Anything (SAM) is drastically accelerating the speed and accuracy of automatically segmenting and labeling large datasets. However, SAM is unable to segment and label images outside of the visible light spectrum via Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imagery. This research creates a codebase, named the Segmentation Mask Transfer Technique (SMTT), to automatically segment and label multispectral imagery by transposing segmentation masks from RGB images onto multispectral images. This study developed a novel method to rapidly segment and label multispectral datasets with high precision. The results from this research demonstrate that when training multispectral models with SMTT, the overall mean average precision (mAP) decreased by 6.7% when compared to models trained on a manually labeled dataset. However, segmenting and labeling a 2,400-image dataset with SMTT takes four hours when compared to the traditional manual method of approximately 40 total hours, resulting in a 90% reduction in model training time. This research greatly contributes to the study of multispectral object detection by providing a novel and open-source method to rapidly segment, label, and train multispectral object detection models with minimal human interaction. Finally, this research quantifies a variety of performance metrics, including SAM, SMTT, YOLOv8, and traditional labeling techniques.
